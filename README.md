# Thermo-mechanical  and Optical simulations
 The source file the thermo-mechanical simulation for the  top microheater is provided in uheateratthetop.fes file.   

The source file for the thermo-mechanical simulations for the buried microheater is provided in the buriedmicrometer.fes file.  
Both these source files should be uploaded to FEATool. FEATool will be used to obtain the thermal and deformations in the polymer waveguide.

 The bpmsolver.m file is the source file for optical simulation. It should be opened and run by using MATLAB.
