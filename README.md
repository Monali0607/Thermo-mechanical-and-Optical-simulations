# Thermo-mechanical  and Optical simulations
 The source file the thermo-mechanical simulation for the  top microheater is provided in uheateratthetop.fes file.   The source file for the thermo-mechanical simulations for the buried microheater is provided in the buriedmicrometer.fes file.   Both these source file could be run by using the FEATool.   The bpmsolver.m file is the source file for optical simulation in MATLAB.
